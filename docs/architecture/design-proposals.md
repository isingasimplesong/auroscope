# AURoscope technical design proposals

## Status and decision protocol

**Status:** Proposed for Mathieu's review except where an accepted ADR is linked explicitly. A recommendation alone is never acceptance.

This document intentionally contains no implementation plan and no production code. As Mathieu accepts, rejects, or amends the numbered decisions in [Decision set](#decision-set-for-mathieu), accepted choices are split into ADRs. Only after the consequential ADRs are accepted may `docs/implementation/initial-plan.md` be written.

## 1. Grounded baseline and proof

### Versions investigated

- Paru stable upstream: `v2.1.0`, commit `70f66dc9eddb40e264ee6c9197541262b7792c9c`.
- Paru AUR recipe: `2.1.0-2`, AUR commit `329be2113c590046cb29858c23d9b96a8d7bd586`.
- Paru post-release reference: upstream `master` commit `9ac3578807a87858651e81a02586ceb947686e7c`; selection-stream fix commit `d1dfbc48895a2a3b3fadc14569c3f2ffb5112b2e`.
- Pacman/makepkg upstream: `v7.1.0`, commit `5683f8477a0afcc6b331766175a83445b2dcfe89`.
- Current Arch Pacman package: `7.1.0.r9.g54d9411-2`, packaging commit `abdc0dfedf3ca553a02dde8551e972fe745535b7`, upstream patch-level commit `54d94116164b0b2202c6061c4a59c6f3e70820d8`.[9]
- Go spikes: host Go `1.24.4`; current Arch package observed as `2:1.27.0-1` in a disposable container.

Paru's manuals state that bare invocation is `paru -Syu`, bare search terms are an alias for sync interactive selection, `--interactive` is intended to feed selected packages to another tool, and `PreBuildCommand` runs once per package base via `sh -c` in the recipe directory with `PKGBASE` and `VERSION` set.[1][2]

Pacman 7.1 documents repository transaction printing, complete `-Syu` semantics, query/origin filters, cache behavior, and the distinction among `--root`, `--sysroot`, `--dbpath`, and absolute cache/hook paths.[10]

Makepkg documents its output roots and exit codes, but its implementation sources the PKGBUILD before handling `--printsrcinfo`, `--packagelist`, or `--verifysource` results.[11][12][13]

### Disposable spikes performed

1. **Makepkg execution boundary.** In `archlinux:base-devel` with makepkg `7.1.0`, a PKGBUILD with a harmless top-level marker write was invoked separately with `--printsrcinfo`, `--packagelist`, and `--verifysource`. Every command exited `0` and wrote the marker. Therefore none is a safe inspection parser.
2. **Paru/libalpm compatibility.** Building the exact `v2.1.0` lockfile against libalpm `16.0.1` failed because `alpm 4.0.3` supports libalpm 15. Repeating the AUR recipe's `cargo update alpm alpm-utils` produced a working `paru v2.1.0 - libalpm v16.0.1`.[8]
3. **Stable Paru selection stream.** With the current AUR-style `v2.1.0` build, `paru -Ssaq --interactive paru` put the menu and selected name on stdout, stderr was empty, and the process exited `1`. The cause is the released file-descriptor code.[3][5]
4. **Post-release selection stream.** Upstream commit `d1dfbc4` fixes stdout redirection.[6] At `9ac3578`, the same spike put only `paru` on stdout, the menu on stderr, and still exited `1`.[7]
5. **SQLite driver comparison.** Minimal foreign-key/WAL programs were built and run. `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 v1.14.50`: 3,608,224-byte stripped binary, 2 modules total, CGO required at runtime. `modernc.org/sqlite v1.57.0`: 6,299,940-byte stripped binary, 26 modules total, pure-Go cross-build succeeded, and this version requires Go 1.25 or newer.
6. **Paru config and local-build boundary.** A generated config that included a user config containing `PreBuildCommand = /bin/false` and then set AURoscope's command successfully ran the later command, confirming simple override order. The same benign `paru -B` spike printed `Generating .SRCINFO` and invoked makepkg before `PreBuildCommand`; local PKGBUILD planning therefore crosses the execution boundary before the guard. A second config defined a hostile-marker PKGBUILD repository with forced SRCINFO generation; `paru -P --order --mode=ar -- paru` left the marker absent, proving the forced mode clears configured PKGBUILD repositories before scanning on the inspected post-fix commit.

Detailed evidence is preserved in `docs/dependency-notes/`.

## 2. Exact Paru/Pacman contract

### Options

#### Option A — transparent wrapper plus pre-build audit only

Run Paru once with inherited terminal streams; use `PreBuildCommand` to audit and prompt.

**Advantages**

- closest to bare Paru;
- minimal resolver duplication;
- works with stable Paru 2.1 selection.

**Costs and rejection reason**

- `PreBuildCommand` occurs after planning and download, before Paru's own review, not immediately before each actual build.[4]
- it cannot prepare a complete review before execution, and cannot safely separate deterministic evidence, model evidence, and durable human decisions at the wrapper level;
- Paru's own review can mutate files after the guard;
- a same-version cached artifact can be installed although approval covered only recipe files.

This does not satisfy the accepted specification without changing the meaning of the pre-build hook.

#### Option B — two-stage Paru orchestration with a narrow guard

Use Paru's supported machine-oriented surfaces for selection/planning, inspect and decide in AURoscope, then invoke Paru for execution with a transaction-scoped `PreBuildCommand`.

**Advantages**

- preserves Paru selection and resolver instead of copying them;
- review and approval happen before executable Paru work;
- `PreBuildCommand` remains a narrow identity check;
- clear place to persist the plan, evidence, decisions, and outcomes.

**Costs**

- planning and execution are separate resolver runs, so the guard must reject drift;
- current stable Paru 2.1 cannot cleanly separate menu output from selected targets;
- no single documented Paru JSON transaction-plan API exists.

**Recommendation:** Option B, with explicit compatibility gates and no durable parsing of human UI beyond ADR-0002's strictly bounded transitional 2.1.0 adapter.

**Decision:** Option B was accepted on 2026-08-30. Paru remains responsible for selection, resolution, build, and installation across separate planning and execution runs; any drift from the reviewed plan returns to review. See [`ADR-0003`](../decisions/0003-multi-stage-paru-orchestration.md).

#### Option C — link to or reimplement Paru/libalpm internals

**Advantage:** richer typed plan.

**Costs and rejection reason:** makes AURoscope a second Paru frontend/resolver, couples Go to Rust/libalpm internals, and violates the product boundary.

### Argument classification

| Input class | v1 behavior | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `--help`, `--version`, completion, pure `-Q`, `-F`, `-D`, `-T` | transparent pass-through | no AUR recipe build |
| pure `-R`, `-Sc`, `-G`, `-L`, `-C`, non-installing `-P` | transparent pass-through, preserving terminal/status | may touch Paru state but does not build a recipe |
| `-Ss`, `-Si`, `-Sl`, `-Qu` without install | pass-through | informational only |
| bare search terms | intercept selection → plan → review → execute | may select AUR recipes |
| `-S <targets>` | intercept unless an explicit trusted repo-only mode proves no AUR build is possible | explicit install may resolve AUR targets/dependencies |
| bare invocation, `-Su`, `-Syu`, `-Sua` | intercept upgrade flow | may build installed foreign packages |
| `-B <dirs>`, bare targetless `-U`, path-like sync targets (including `./...`), and targets resolved from PKGBUILD repositories | reject as unsupported in v1 before starting Paru | local paths can invoke makepkg `--printsrcinfo` before `PreBuildCommand`; safe support needs a separate design ([ADR-0014](../decisions/0014-reject-local-pkgbuild-inputs-in-v1.md)) |
| `-U <package files/URLs>` | pass-through to Paru/Pacman in v1 | installs package archives, not AUR recipes; package-archive inspection is deferred |
| `--downloadonly` with AUR target | preserve Paru rejection | Paru 2.1 explicitly rejects this combination |
| `--noconfirm` with any new AUR decision | reject with AURoscope policy exit | conflicts with default human authority; later automation needs an explicit policy ADR |
| ambiguous/unknown operation combination | pass-through only if classification proves it cannot build; otherwise fail before mutation | fail safe at the boundary, not by guessing |

Argument parsing must classify only AURoscope-owned subcommands and the minimum Pacman/Paru operation grammar. It must retain the original argv byte-for-byte for transparent execution; it must not normalize unknown options.

### Native interactive selection

Proposed command for search selection:

```text
paru -Ssaq --interactive -- <terms>
```

The menu inherits the real terminal through stderr; stdout is captured as newline-delimited selected package names. The observed success contract is unusual: Paru's sync-search path returns `1`, including when selection succeeds.[3] AURoscope therefore accepts this `1` only when:

- the subprocess is exactly the selection stage;
- stdout contains one or more syntactically valid selected names;
- every line is bounded and contains no control characters;
- the child was not terminated by a signal.

Cancellation is `1` plus empty selection and maps to AURoscope `cancelled`, not `failed`.

**Accepted compatibility boundary:** the durable target is the first stable Paru release containing `d1dfbc4`, but Paru 2.1.0 may be supported meanwhile by an isolated, explicitly temporary adapter for its verified combined stdout format.[5][6] That adapter must accept only bounded, unambiguous tested output and fail closed on format or locale divergence. A pinned `paru-git`/upstream commit remains limited to design, development, and contract tests. Both adapters require executable capability tests; the version string alone is insufficient. See [ADR-0002](../decisions/0002-paru-native-selection-compatibility.md).

### Planning and authoritative origin

1. Paru remains authoritative for AUR/repository origin and dependency classification within supported modes. The classifier interprets user mode selectors but never forwards them blindly: any mode containing `pkgbuilds`/`p` is rejected; repo-only is normalized to a final trusted `--repo`, AUR-only (including `-Sua`) to a final trusted `--aur`, and default/combined repo+AUR to trusted `--repo --mode=aur`. These flags are inserted after user options and before the target separator, so they reset config-provided `PkgbuildsOnly` rather than OR-ing with it. Explicit local build operations and local path targets (`./`, `../`, absolute paths, or `file:`; repository-qualified `repo/pkg` remains valid) fail before any Paru process starts. Any `PKGBUILD` record is a contract violation and aborts. This accepted v1 boundary is defined by [ADR-0014](../decisions/0014-reject-local-pkgbuild-inputs-in-v1.md).
2. For explicit selected targets, use Paru's `paru -P --order -- <targets>` output as a version-gated planning surface. Released `v2.1.0` documents repository records as `INSTALL TARGET|DEP|MAKE <repo> <name>`, while post-release commit `9ac3578` actually emits `REPO TARGET|DEP|MAKE <repo> <name>` from `src/order.rs` although its man page still says `INSTALL`; AUR records remain `AUR TARGET|DEP|MAKE <pkgbase> <names...>`.[1][26]
3. Parse only the grammar proven for the exact supported build. Reject unknown record kinds, documentation/code mismatches, `MISSING`, and conflicts rather than treating them as harmless. The `--order` spike returned `0` with complete synced databases and `1` plus `MISSING` records when repository databases were absent.
4. Confirm repository packages independently with Pacman `-S --print --print-format` where a repository transaction is about to run. Pacman's repository order is authoritative.[10]
5. Committed `.SRCINFO` and AUR RPC metadata are planning data only. Never regenerate `.SRCINFO` with makepkg during inspection.
6. Before execution, clone/fetch each planned `pkgbase`, resolve the candidate commit, enumerate the Git tree, and inspect that immutable candidate.
7. During execution, an unplanned AUR `PKGBASE` reaching the guard aborts the whole AUR phase before repository build dependencies are installed; Paru 2.1 runs all pre-build commands before its repository dependency installation.[4]

**Unresolved proof:** bare sysupgrade has no documented single machine-readable `--order` equivalent for the full combined repository+AUR plan. The recommended upgrade split below avoids claiming one.

### Complete official upgrades and deferred AUR work

#### Option A — Paru combined upgrade with injected ignores

Keeps one combined flow, but refresh may occur before AUR review, failure after refresh leaves the user responsible for completing the upgrade, and deriving a stable complete plan is weak.[1][2]

#### Option B — provisional AUR review, then repository and AUR phases

Discover, plan, and review AUR updates before the official transaction, run the complete repository upgrade, then repeat AUR planning and review against the resulting state.

This exposes possible AUR consequences before any mutation, but the first plan is necessarily provisional. Official package versions, providers, origins, and dependency closure can change, so the duplicated review does not eliminate the intermediate compatibility risk.

#### Option C — native repository phase, then AUR review and execution

1. Run the complete official repository upgrade through Paru's repository-only mode (`paru -Syu --repo`, or a contract-tested equivalent) with inherited terminal and exact child status. AURoscope adds no audit or approval layer to this official phase and excludes no official package.
2. Only after that phase succeeds, discover AUR updates with the exact supported Paru query adapter (for the inspected branch, quiet AUR upgrades are emitted one package name per line by `paru -Quaq`), force supported `aur,repo` mode, and feed AUR names through the version-gated `--order` planner.
3. Clone and inspect the exact AUR recipes against the current post-upgrade state, then collect human decisions. Any later candidate, identity, origin/provider, or dependency-closure drift returns to human review before AUR execution.
4. Compute the exclusion closure from the proven AUR plan (every package emitted by a held `pkgbase`, plus dependants that cannot resolve without it), then execute `paru -Sua` with one exact `--ignore` value for each excluded package; reject any unplanned guard call. If Paru's fresh resolution reports a different closure, stop and return to review rather than installing a guessed subset.

**Decision:** Option C was accepted on 2026-08-30. It keeps the official transaction native and complete, audits only AUR work, and avoids a knowingly provisional pre-upgrade review. The accepted residual risk is that an already-installed AUR package may be temporarily incompatible after the official upgrade; withholding official packages is not an allowed mitigation. See [`ADR-0004`](../decisions/0004-official-upgrade-before-aur-review.md).

### Execution hardening and cache behavior

- Generate a transaction-specific Paru config in a private runtime directory and select it with `PARU_CONF`; do not edit the user's Paru config. Before overriding the environment, resolve the original effective config (`PARU_CONF`, XDG user file, then `/etc/paru.conf`). If it exists, the generated file first `Include`s that exact trusted absolute path and then declares a final `[bin]` section with AURoscope's `PreBuildCommand`, so the transaction guard wins by parse order. Paru's parser reads `Include` immediately and later directives replace the optional command value.[25] Contract-test nested includes, missing files, repeated sections, and paths containing whitespace.
- Force `--skipreview` during the execution run because AURoscope already reviewed the recipe and Paru's own file-manager review occurs after the pre-build hook.[2][4]
- Never add `--noconfirm` to the user's final Pacman confirmation.
- A recipe approval does not approve an arbitrary cached package file. Default v1 rule: force rebuild unless SQLite contains a successful AURoscope build record for the same recipe identity and exact package-artifact SHA-256. Reusable artifacts are verified before `pacman -U`.
- Do not run `makepkg --packagelist` to predict output during inspection; it executes top-level PKGBUILD code.[11][12]
- Preserve child exit status for transparent flows. For intercepted flows store: normalized AURoscope category, exact child exit code, and terminating signal separately.
- On SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP, forward to the child's process group, wait, invalidate unconsumed approvals, clean runtime handoff, and exit as signal-derived status. Go's `os/exec` does not invoke a shell implicitly; process-group and signal policy must be explicit.[18][19]

### Minimum compatibility boundary

- Pacman/makepkg: support `7.1.x` initially; test both upstream `v7.1.0` and Arch's packaged patch level.
- Paru execution features: `2.1.0-2` behavior is the inspected floor for planning/guard mechanics.
- Paru native selection capture: the durable floor is the first stable release containing `d1dfbc4`; until it exists and passes the capability matrix, allow a strictly bounded temporary adapter for verified Paru 2.1.0 output.
- At startup, verify `paru --version`, `pacman --version`, and `makepkg --version`; run feature-level contract tests in release CI. Version strings alone cannot distinguish patched Paru 2.1 builds, and the temporary adapter must reject output outside its tested grammar.

## 3. Go architecture and direct dependencies

### Proposed package boundaries

```text
cmd/auroscope          command entry only
internal/cli           classify argv and AURoscope subcommands
internal/config        XDG discovery, defaults, validation
internal/process       argv-only subprocesses, process groups, signals
internal/paru          versioned Paru adapter and parsers
internal/recipe        Git identity, safe manifest, diff/context
internal/scanner       deterministic immutable findings
internal/llm           HTTP/Codex backend selection and validation
internal/review        terminal presentation and human decisions
internal/store         SQLite transactions, migrations, queries
internal/approval      approval lifecycle and guard command
internal/report        text/Markdown/JSON rendering from typed state
```

This is one executable and one process except for deliberate external commands. Packages are domain boundaries, not interfaces-for-everything. Define interfaces only at actual nondeterministic boundaries used by tests: clock/randomness, process runner, model transport, and store transaction.

### CLI/process options

- **Framework CLI:** convenient help generation, but risks fighting passthrough semantics. Not recommended.
- **Standard library parser/classifier:** retain raw argv and parse only enough grammar to identify owned subcommands and mutation risk. Recommended.
- **PTY for all Paru calls:** maximizes TTY likeness but multiplexes output and makes machine capture fragile. Rejected.
- **Direct inherited descriptors:** pass-through uses `Stdin/Stdout/Stderr = os.*`; selection inherits stdin+stderr and captures only stdout. Recommended.
- **`github.com/creack/pty`:** defer. Add only if an executable contract test proves a required Paru/Pacman prompt refuses inherited descriptors without a controlling terminal.[22]

### SQLite driver options

#### `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`

- small dependency surface and smaller measured binary;
- embeds SQLite through CGO; Arch `base-devel` makes the build practical;
- target-specific CGO builds complicate cross-compilation, but v1 targets only Arch `linux/amd64`.[20]

#### `modernc.org/sqlite`

- pure Go and easy target cross-build;
- larger measured binary and dependency graph;
- current tested version requires Go 1.25+, which current Arch satisfies but the present host Go 1.24.4 does not without toolchain download.[21]

**Accepted in [ADR-0007](../decisions/0007-mattn-go-sqlite3-cgo.md):** `mattn/go-sqlite3 v1.14.50` with CGO for v1. It fits the single target, is materially smaller in the spike, and avoids 24 extra modules. Reconsider a pure-Go driver when cross-target releases become a real requirement. Pin the exact module and SQLite compile options; verify `PRAGMA foreign_keys`, WAL, busy timeout, migrations, integrity/corruption handling, backup/restore, and concurrency in tests.

### Other proposed dependencies

| Need | Proposal | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| config | `github.com/pelletier/go-toml/v2` pinned at design implementation time | readable TOML without inventing a parser; strict unknown-field validation required.[23] |
| SQLite | `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` | fundamental database driver; CGO accepted for Arch v1.[20] |
| PTY | none initially | inherited descriptors satisfy the post-fix Paru selection contract |
| migrations | none | ordered SQL files embedded with `//go:embed`, applied transactionally |
| JSON Schema runtime | none initially | typed `encoding/json`, `DisallowUnknownFields`, size bounds, enum/range/cross-field validation |
| LLM SDK | none | standard-library HTTP plus optional Codex process invocation implement ADR-0011 without a Go SDK/framework |
| logging framework | none | structured records in SQLite plus concise stderr diagnostics |
| shell-word parser | `github.com/mattn/go-shellwords v1.0.14` | parse common `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` values with arguments without invoking a shell; environment and backtick expansion must remain disabled.[27] |

### Build/release

- Build in a clean Arch environment using the repository PKGBUILD; Go and C toolchain are build dependencies, not runtime dependencies.
- Use `-trimpath`, inject version/commit with `-ldflags`, and emit checksums plus SBOM/module list.
- Do not promise a static or distro-independent binary. The accepted target is Arch `linux/amd64`.
- Rebuild twice in clean containers and compare artifacts; if bit-for-bit reproducibility is not achieved, document the variance before release.

## 4. SQLite state model

### Options

- **Event log only:** excellent audit trail, awkward status queries and invariant enforcement.
- **Mutable current-state tables only:** simple queries, weak history and replay evidence.
- **Normalized immutable evidence/history plus explicit mutable lifecycle rows:** accepted balance, constrained to concrete v1 needs.

**Decision:** the scope-narrowed third option was accepted on 2026-08-30. The database is an instrumental product model, not a generic event store: a table or column enters v1 only when it directly serves exact identity/anti-TOCTOU, inspection evidence, an explicit human decision, readable status, or crash recovery, and has a concrete product read or testable invariant. See [`ADR-0009`](../decisions/0009-minimal-sqlite-state-model.md).

### Accepted minimal schema boundary

- migrations: `schema_migrations`;
- recipe identity: `package_bases`, `recipe_identities`, `recipe_files`;
- inspection and decision: `inspections`, `deterministic_findings`, `human_decisions`;
- execution and guard: `transactions`, `transaction_args`, `transaction_recipes`, `approvals`, `process_sessions`;
- outcome evidence: `builds`, `package_artifacts`, `install_outcomes`.

`llm_assessments` is created only by the migration that delivers the LLM assessment feature. Report-retention data and every later persistence addition follow the same rule: grow through a forward migration only with a real workflow, query, and invariant.

### Accepted invariants

- Enforce foreign keys and one coherent identity → inspection → human decision → approval chain.
- Arm an approval only from a human `approve` decision for the same inspection and recipe identity.
- Make `armed → claimed` atomic and one-shot; all lifecycle transitions are monotonic.
- Reuse no package artifact without a successful build tied to the exact identity and recorded artifact hash.
- Preserve recipe paths, process arguments, and working directories as reversible bytes; escaped text is display-only.

Exact columns must be justified by these needs rather than copied speculatively from the earlier sketch. Composite keys, constraints, triggers, or transactional store checks may enforce cross-row invariants, but their SQL form belongs to the implementation and migration tests.

Explicitly deferred are a generic event table or replay framework, generic provenance/EAV/plugin schemas, distributed orchestration, authoritative state on a network filesystem, v1 down migrations, and fields kept merely "just in case." Concurrency, crash, migration, byte-round-trip, and artifact-reuse tests remain mandatory before implementation is considered complete.

### Operational mechanics still proposed

The C-minimal acceptance does not turn every earlier tuning and retention recommendation into an accepted schema requirement. The current operational proposal remains:

- use WAL for normal local-filesystem operation, `foreign_keys=ON`, `busy_timeout=5000`, `synchronous=FULL` for approval state, and one short write transaction at a time.[15][16][17]
- run a locking/WAL self-test when initializing the database and reject authoritative state on network filesystems that cannot provide SQLite's required shared-memory/locking semantics;
- take an application lock under runtime state to prevent two interactive mutating wrappers while still permitting read-only status commands;
- never hold a SQLite transaction while waiting on Paru, the model, an editor, or the user;
- embed, checksum, and apply ordered forward migrations under an exclusive application lock, with backup before migration and restore support;
- on startup, run `PRAGMA quick_check`, expire stale approvals, validate PID plus start time before marking orphaned transactions interrupted, and clean only work owned by recorded transactions.

### Accepted retention defaults

- durable recipe identities, human decisions, and build/install outcomes: 365 days;
- full reports and retained model JSON: 30 days;
- SQLite state backups: 7 days;
- reconstructible recipe cache: 14 days or 512 MiB, LRU, whichever limit is reached first;
- failed temporary-work metadata: 3 days while actual private temp trees are removed at recovery;
- all thresholds are configurable, but none defaults to unlimited retention or disabled purge;
- `VACUUM` only as an explicit maintenance action; routine purge uses incremental vacuum if configured.

No purge may delete an identity referenced by a live transaction, approval, or retained build/install outcome. These limits and the concrete XDG/cleanup boundary are accepted separately in [`ADR-0012`](../decisions/0012-xdg-layout-permissions-retention.md).

## 5. Approval and anti-TOCTOU protocol

**Decision:** The one-shot transaction-ID handoff, complete identity binding, atomic claim, 30-minute default expiry with a configurable 2-hour maximum, and terminal invalidation rules below were accepted on 2026-08-30. See [`ADR-0010`](../decisions/0010-one-shot-approval-protocol.md). The separately accepted final guard timing remains governed by [`ADR-0005`](../decisions/0005-recipe-identity-guard-boundary.md).

### Identity

An approval binds all of:

```text
transaction_id
source_kind + source_namespace + pkgbase
40/64-hex Git commit OID with detected object format
Git tree OID
canonical tracked-file manifest SHA-256
per-file path bytes + object type + mode + size + SHA-256 + Git blob OID
inspection id and scanner contract version
human decision id
workspace device + inode
expiry
```

The commit OID is identity, not a safety score. The manifest additionally detects local changes, untracked relevant files, worktree substitution, and hash-algorithm migration.

### Handoff options

- **Bearer token in environment:** simple, but inherited by subprocesses and unnecessary before recipe execution. Rejected.
- **One-shot token file:** limits accidental reuse but adds secret-file lifecycle without defeating the same-UID threat.
- **Transaction ID plus process/workspace binding in SQLite:** accepted. The transaction ID is not treated as a secret.

### Accepted protocol

1. Wrapper creates transaction and private runtime directory (`0700`), records its own PID/start time.
2. It plans, clones, safely collects, scans, obtains optional LLM assessment, and records the user's decision.
3. For each approved identity it inserts an `armed` approval with a 30-minute default expiry and a configurable maximum of 2 hours.
4. It writes a transaction-specific Paru config (`0600`) whose `PreBuildCommand` is a fixed shell command equivalent to:

   ```text
   exec /usr/bin/auroscope guard --transaction <id>
   ```

   No package-derived text enters that command. Paru still invokes `sh -c`, but the string consists only of fixed syntax and a validated lowercase-hex transaction ID; the leading POSIX `exec` replaces the shell with the guard.
5. Wrapper starts Paru as a child process group with `PARU_CONF` pointing to that private config, records Paru PID, `/proc/<pid>/stat` start ticks, and executable identity.
6. Guard obtains `PKGBASE` from Paru, treats `VERSION` as advisory, opens cwd without following symlink components, verifies cwd device/inode, repository origin, `HEAD`, tree, tracked manifest, relevant untracked files, and every file hash.
7. Guard verifies its parent directly matches the recorded live Paru PID/start time/executable (the POSIX `exec` replaces Paru's mandatory `sh -c` process), and owner UID matches.
8. In `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, guard atomically changes exactly one matching unexpired approval `armed → claimed`. Missing, duplicate, expired, unexpected pkgbase, or changed identity aborts.
9. Guard recomputes the complete no-follow manifest after the atomic claim and requires it to equal both the approved digest and the pre-claim digest, then records verification digest/time and exits `0`. On any error it marks the approval invalid and exits a dedicated nonzero guard code.
10. Wrapper observes Paru/build outcome. A successful exact build changes `claimed → consumed`; cancellation/failure invalidates every remaining `armed` or `claimed` approval. A claimed approval is never reusable by a later Paru process.
11. A cached package may be reused only when its SHA-256 is already linked to a successful build of this exact identity. Otherwise execution forces rebuild.

### Accepted-specification conflict: hook timing

The accepted specification currently says `PreBuildCommand` verifies "immediately before each build." Paru 2.1 does not provide that timing: it runs all package-base hooks together, then can perform later non-recipe work before individual makepkg calls.[4] This must not be silently redefined.

- **Option A — amend the guarantee to the actual security boundary:** the hook is the final complete recipe-content verification before Paru invokes any makepkg/recipe code; `--skipreview` removes Paru's later edit path, and the manifest is computed twice around the atomic claim. Repository dependency installation may occur later. **Recommended**, because no hostile recipe code runs in the interval and the remaining same-UID race is already explicit.
- **Option B — require an upstream Paru per-build hook:** preserves the literal wording, but blocks production on an upstream change and still cannot defeat a malicious same-UID process after return.
- **Option C — interpose an AURoscope makepkg proxy:** can reverify immediately before every makepkg invocation, but becomes a materially broader process boundary, must handle multiple source/prepare/build invocations and VCS `pkgver()` mutations, and needs separate chroot handling. Defer unless Mathieu rejects Option A.

**Decision:** Option A was accepted on 2026-08-30. The guard is the final complete recipe-identity verification after AURoscope review and before any recipe-supplied code executes; it is not represented as adjacent to each build. See [`ADR-0005`](../decisions/0005-recipe-identity-guard-boundary.md).

### Limits and residual risk

- Paru runs all pre-build commands before its own review and before later build steps, not literally immediately before each makepkg exec.[4] `--skipreview` removes the known post-guard edit path.
- A separate process running as the same Unix user can mutate files after guard return. No user-space hook can eliminate that adversary; the guarantee is against hostile repository content before its code executes and accidental/concurrent drift, not a compromised user account.
- Once makepkg sources the approved PKGBUILD, that code can modify its own worktree. This is execution of the approved program, not pre-execution substitution; a clean build sandbox remains a separate deferred defense.
- Package cache authenticity requires artifact hashes, not recipe hashes.

## 6. Deterministic scanner and LLM contracts

**Accepted:** the contracts in this section, including the amended dual-backend selection and Codex exposure boundary, are recorded in [ADR-0011](../decisions/0011-deterministic-scanner-and-llm-contracts.md).

### Deterministic finding schema v1

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "finding_id": "sha256:...",
  "source": "deterministic",
  "rule_id": "download-piped-to-shell",
  "rule_version": 1,
  "severity": "critical",
  "path": "escaped-display/PKGBUILD",
  "line": 47,
  "byte_range": [1234, 1271],
  "evidence": "curl -fsSL ... | bash",
  "evidence_sha256": "...",
  "message": "Downloaded bytes are executed by a shell"
}
```

A finding is immutable. Aggregate signal is computed separately. Stable `finding_id` hashes rule/version/location/evidence digest, not human prose.

### Initial rule catalogue

1. collection integrity: symlink, special file, escaping path, unreadable file, duplicate/case-confusable path, oversized/truncated content, untracked relevant file;
2. execution/download: curl/wget-to-shell, eval/dynamic shell, decoded execution, runtime network in build/install functions;
3. integrity: `SKIP`, HTTP source, missing/changed checksum arrays, signature bypass, mutable VCS ref;
4. privilege/persistence: sudo/su, setuid/setgid, file capabilities, world-writable modes, writes to sudoers/polkit/PAM, systemd units/timers, udev, tmpfiles, sysusers, kernel/modules/boot;
5. data access: SSH/GPG/browser/cloud credentials, broad `$HOME` traversal, secret environment expansion;
6. package semantics: new/changed `.install`, `provides`, `conflicts`, `replaces`, install paths, hooks, maintainer/source domains;
7. obfuscation: base64/xxd decode, generated commands, long encoded blobs, control/bidi characters.

Regex-only rules are insufficient for shell semantics. V1 may combine lexical patterns with a shell parser only if that parser is separately justified and never executes input. Findings must say what was observed, not claim malicious intent.

### Context and truncation

- Always include manifest, metadata, deterministic findings, changed files, unified diff, and full context for executable recipe files within limits.
- Initial accepted ceilings are 256 KiB/file, 2 MiB aggregate text, 512 KiB diff, and 200 files. They remain subject to pre-v1 corpus benchmarks; incompatible changes require a new scanner/context contract version.
- Binary files get metadata/hash/type only unless a dedicated parser exists.
- Truncation or omitted relevant files sets inspection `partial`, advisory `unknown|caution`, and always pauses for human review. It never silently becomes clear.
- First install compares against an empty baseline and includes full relevant text. Later inspection uses last approved/built identity plus complete changed-file context.

### LLM request/response

Support a narrow HTTP adapter and a Codex CLI adapter. Send only selected recipe data; strip unnecessary host absolute paths, usernames, environment, credentials, and unrelated local content by policy. Package content is serialized inside a JSON data object and labelled untrusted; prompt-injection text remains data, never policy.

Response v1 contains only:

```text
contract_version
advisory_level: informational|caution|high|unknown
summary (bounded)
change_explanations[]
attention_items[] {path, line?, severity, observation, uncertainty}
uncertainties[]
```

It contains no `approve`, `allow`, `deny`, or final decision field. Local validation requires known paths, real line ranges, bounded strings/counts, no extra fields, and valid UTF-8. Deterministic findings are supplied read-only and are not echoed as authoritative replacements.

### Provider/config/privacy contract

- Explicit backend selection always wins: `codex`, a supported API backend, or `disabled`.
- Automatic mode prefers a complete OpenAI, OpenRouter, or custom OpenAI-compatible configuration consisting of provider/endpoint, API-key reference, and model. Without one, it uses an installed and authenticated Codex CLI.
- The Codex model is configurable and defaults to exactly `5.6-luna` when omitted.
- Explicitly incomplete configuration, unauthenticated Codex, timeout, transport failure, provider refusal, or invalid output is visible and actionable. It yields LLM signal `unknown` and a human pause, with no silent backend or model fallback.
- Run Codex outside the recipe repository in a private temporary directory containing only bounded redacted input. Do not deliberately pass business secrets or unnecessary host paths. Codex may retain its normal tools; this is exposure reduction, not a sandbox guarantee. Its output remains untrusted and must pass the same local schema and reference validation as HTTP output.
- `disabled` is supported; deterministic inspection remains distinct and does not pretend model evidence exists.

Human approval remains possible after a visible model failure in interactive human-authority mode; failure is neither veto nor approval.

Log request/response hashes and bounded redacted metadata. Raw prompts/responses are `0600`, retained by explicit policy, and omitted entirely when privacy mode disables them. Secrets are referenced by environment-variable name, never stored in TOML or SQLite.

### Historical reference used narrowly

From `2027a/paru-llm-audit`, retain only proven ideas/fixtures: tracked-artifact inventory, no-follow collection, escaped terminal output, visible truncation findings, prompt-injection fixtures, strict model output validation, and before/after snapshot comparison.[24]

Do **not** inherit its hook-centered architecture, aggregate automatic allow/block policy, Python code, or mutable acceptance state. AURoscope's accepted Codex adapter is a new bounded backend contract under its different human-authority and transaction model, not inherited code or policy.

## 7. Configuration, XDG, reports, and cleanup

The XDG Base Directory specification assigns configuration, durable state, cache, and runtime files distinct roots.[14]

### Accepted exact layout

The layout, private-permission checks, cleanup boundary, and finite retention defaults below are accepted in [ADR-0012](../decisions/0012-xdg-layout-permissions-retention.md).

```text
${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/auroscope/config.toml                  0600
${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/auroscope/state.db                0600
${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/auroscope/reports/YYYY/MM/...     0600 files, 0700 dirs
${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/auroscope/backups/                 0700
${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/auroscope/recipes/<source>/<pkgbase>/    0700 root
${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/auroscope/model/                         0700, optional
${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/auroscope/<transaction>/                              preferred, 0700
${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/auroscope-<uid>-<random>/<transaction>/                  fallback, 0700
```

If `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is set, require an absolute path owned by the user with safe permissions. Otherwise create the fallback with `os.MkdirTemp`; never use predictable names. Start with umask `0077`, create all AURoscope roots as `0700`, and verify SQLite's `-wal`/`-shm` auxiliary files remain private. Refuse config/state/cache roots that are relative, symlinks at sensitive final components, not owned by the user, or group/world writable.

### Config proposal

TOML with explicit sections: `[policy]`, `[paths]`, `[scanner]`, `[llm]`, `[review]`, `[retention]`, `[compatibility]`. Unknown keys are errors. Defaults live in code; no required config file. CLI overrides are explicit and recorded in the transaction. Arrays represent commands (`viewer = ["nvim", "-f"]`) so no shell parsing is required.

`$VISUAL`, then `$EDITOR`, then pager fallback applies when no configured argv exists. Parse the selected environment value with `mattn/go-shellwords` while explicitly disabling environment-variable and backtick expansion; require at least one argv element, resolve the executable without elevation, and append the report path as a new argv element. Never invoke `/bin/sh -c` or interpolate the path into command text.[27]

### Reports

- Render reports from SQLite plus immutable recipe blobs; reports are not read back.
- Atomic write: private temp file in destination directory, `fsync`, rename, directory `fsync` where supported.
- Escape control characters, bidi controls, invalid UTF-8, and terminal sequences.
- `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` receives a read-only generated report, not the build workspace. “Inspect recipe” opens a private copy or pager; direct edits require an explicit edit workflow followed by rehash/reinspection.

### Cleanup protocol

- Every transaction owns one recorded work root and a marker containing transaction ID, owner UID, creation time, and random nonce; marker data is not authority by itself.
- `defer` cleanup immediately after child exit; signal handler requests cancellation, while normal unwinding performs deletion.
- Remove directory contents using descriptor-relative, no-follow traversal; never `RemoveAll` a path reconstructed solely from package text or marker content.
- On startup and `auroscope cleanup`, enumerate only direct children of the configured AURoscope runtime/cache root, cross-check SQLite ownership, PID+start time, age, device, inode, and UID, then delete.
- Default stale runtime grace: 24 hours. Active recorded process sessions are never removed.
- Cache pruning is quota+age based, uses a lock, and never follows symlinks. Reports/state are not cache.

### Retention policy

- Recipe identities, human decisions, and build/install outcomes: 365 days.
- Generated reports and retained model JSON: 30 days.
- SQLite state backups: 7 days.
- Reconstructible recipe cache: 14 days or 512 MiB under LRU pruning, whichever limit is reached first.
- Failed-work metadata: 3 days; recovered temporary trees are removed immediately.

Every threshold is configurable, but no category has unlimited retention or disabled purge by default. Purging must preserve evidence referenced by a live transaction, approval, or retained build/install outcome.

## 8. Threat model

Accepted boundary: [ADR-0013](../decisions/0013-aur-supply-chain-threat-model-and-v1-test-gates.md).

AURoscope protects the quality of a human AUR review. It treats the recipe repository, its files and metadata, source/upstream material, and all package-derived scanner or model input as hostile data. It must inspect those inputs without executing them, preserve the provenance of each indicator, expose uncertainty and failure, and leave the install decision to the user.

The local machine, user account, other local processes, configuration and editors are trusted by this model. Paru, Pacman, makepkg, and Git are trusted versioned dependencies whose compatibility is tested. AURoscope is not a sandbox, antivirus, endpoint-protection tool, or security boundary against a compromised host.

Supply-chain abuse cases in scope are deliberately narrow:

| Hostile AUR input | Required behavior | Residual risk/proof |
|---|---|---|
| suspicious or obfuscated recipe behavior | deterministic corpus covers every advertised indicator and preserves evidence provenance | indicators can miss malicious behavior; no “safe” verdict |
| recipe/source content attempting prompt injection | package content remains delimited data; the model has no decision/action field; output is strictly validated; Codex receives only bounded redacted input outside the repository | model advice can still be wrong; Codex tools are not sandboxed |
| `PKGBUILD`, source, symlink, path, or filename causing execution during inspection | collection and analysis never source or execute package content; rendering is escaped and bounded | marker fixtures provide executable proof |
| malformed, oversized, partial, or failed analysis | explicit visible failure/limitation; no silent approval and no automatic veto | user still decides with incomplete evidence |
| confusing or unattributed findings | readable report separates deterministic and LLM evidence and identifies indicator provenance | presentation tests cover the decision surface |

Recipe identity checks, SQLite consistency, process handling, locking, cleanup, and dependency contracts remain functional design concerns. They receive proportional regression tests, but are not presented as resistance to malicious local processes under this threat model.

## 9. Risk-proportional test strategy

Ordinary correctness remains covered by focused unit, parser/fuzz, SQLite/migration, process, and supported-version contract tests. Those suites validate behavior described by the other decisions; they are not security claims against a hostile local machine.

The accepted v1 security quality gates are only:

1. **Recipe corpus:** benign and suspicious fixtures cover every advertised rule or indicator, including false-positive and obfuscation cases.
2. **No execution during inspection:** marker fixtures prove that collection, deterministic scanning, and model-context preparation execute or source neither `PKGBUILD` nor package source material.
3. **Faithful presentation and human authority:** tests prove readable alerts, indicator provenance, immutable separation of deterministic and LLM evidence, explicit partial/failed analysis, and absence of an automatic install decision.
4. **Disposable Arch E2E:** a private container or VM exercises inspection → evidence presentation → explicit human decision → installation. It uses synthetic repositories and a private Pacman root/database and never targets the real workstation.

Functional end-to-end coverage may additionally exercise repo-only pass-through, mixed repo/AUR dependencies, upgrades, native selection, cancellation, migrations, cleanup, packaging, and the D4 identity guard. Those are release-confidence tests, not additions to the accepted threat boundary.

## 10. Unresolved risks and explicit non-goals

- Current stable Paru does not satisfy clean native selection capture. ADR-0002 permits a temporary fail-closed 2.1.0 parser, but format and locale drift can disable that adapter; the clean durable contract still depends on a stable release containing `d1dfbc4`.
- Paru lacks a stable JSON plan API; its documented text grammar must be contract-tested and version-gated.
- Transaction-specific config layering is grounded in Paru's parser, but still needs an executable spike for nested includes, repeated sections, whitespace paths, and preservation of every supported user option before ADR acceptance.
- A compromised local account or machine can tamper with AURoscope, its state, display, or execution flow; local-host protection is outside the accepted threat model.
- Upstream source archives and compiled binary behavior remain out of scope; approval says “reviewed recipe,” never “safe software.”
- Clean chroot/sandbox builds are valuable but remain deferred unless Mathieu expands scope.
- Non-interactive autonomous approve/reject policy remains deferred and requires a separate ADR.

Workflow for every decision issue:

1. The issue body starts with the exact first-line marker `MODE: DECISION`; the watcher keeps it under `Agent/Human` and never starts implementation.
2. Mathieu replies with his chosen option, amendment, question, or rejection. Each new ordinary comment creates only a bounded scratch discussion task: Héphaïstos may answer in the issue but may not edit the repository, create an ADR/PR, close the issue, or implement code.
3. When the latest concrete proposal is accepted, Mathieu posts a comment whose entire trimmed content is exactly `GO DECISION`. The watcher accepts it only from Mathieu's pinned Forgejo login and numeric user ID, and only when it is the latest external comment.
4. The watcher then transfers responsibility to `Agent/Hermes` and creates an idempotent decision-finalization task. Only then may Héphaïstos record the decision in an ADR, update design/specification documents, verify the remote commit/PR, comment the evidence, and close the issue.
5. `GO DECISION` never authorizes production implementation or the implementation plan. Any resulting work requires a separate issue starting with `MODE: EXECUTION`.

Issues without an exact mode marker fall back to a single existing routing label; missing or conflicting routing is classified `Agent/Needs Review` and executes nothing. Until step 3 is complete and the resulting ADR is committed for a given decision, that item remains **Proposed**. Accepted items below link to their ADR. The PR itself is evidence and discussion material, not approval.

Please accept, amend, reject, or defer each item. Recommendations are not yet decisions.

1. **D1 — Paru compatibility — Accepted in [ADR-0002](../decisions/0002-paru-native-selection-compatibility.md):** retain the first stable Paru release containing `d1dfbc4` as the durable floor; meanwhile permit an isolated, temporary, fail-closed adapter for verified 2.1.0 output. Detect capability behaviorally and remove the adapter after a fixed stable release passes the contract matrix. A pinned post-fix commit remains design/test-only.
2. **D2 — orchestration — Accepted in [ADR-0003](../decisions/0003-multi-stage-paru-orchestration.md):** adopt two-stage Paru planning/review/execution; do not parse Paru's human UI beyond ADR-0002's temporary 2.1.0 exception, and never replace its resolver.
3. **D3 — upgrades — Accepted in [ADR-0004](../decisions/0004-official-upgrade-before-aur-review.md):** run the complete official repository upgrade first with native Paru/Pacman behavior and no added AURoscope review; only then plan, inspect, approve, and independently defer AUR work against the resulting system state.
4. **D4 — execution/cache and specification amendment — Accepted in [ADR-0005](../decisions/0005-recipe-identity-guard-boundary.md):** treat the guard as the final complete recipe-identity verification after AURoscope review and before any recipe-supplied code executes, without claiming that it is adjacent to each build; run with `--skipreview`, and rebuild unless a cached artifact hash is tied to the exact approved identity.
5. **D5 — Go process architecture:** one executable, explicit internal packages, standard-library argv/process handling, no CLI framework and no PTY dependency initially. **Recommended: accept.**
6. **D6 — SQLite driver — Accepted:** use `mattn/go-sqlite3 v1.14.50` with CGO for Arch `linux/amd64` v1; revisit pure Go only with real cross-target need. Record: [ADR-0007](../decisions/0007-mattn-go-sqlite3-cgo.md).
7. **D7 — remaining dependencies — Accepted:** TOML via `pelletier/go-toml/v2`, `$VISUAL` parsing via `mattn/go-shellwords v1.0.14` with environment and backtick expansion disabled, embedded SQL migrations, typed local LLM validation, and no LLM SDK/framework or PTY dependency without demonstrated need. See [ADR-0008](../decisions/0008-minimal-direct-go-dependencies.md).
8. **D8 — state model — Accepted in [ADR-0009](../decisions/0009-minimal-sqlite-state-model.md):** normalized immutable evidence/decisions plus only the mutable lifecycle rows required for identity, inspection, human authority, status, and recovery; no generic event-sourcing, provenance, EAV, plugin, or speculative schema.
9. **D9 — approval protocol:** transaction/process/workspace-bound one-shot approvals, 30-minute default expiry, atomic claim, all terminal states invalidate leftovers, explicit same-UID residual risk, and human approval remains representable after visibly recorded partial/failed analysis. **Recommended: accept.**
10. **D10 — scanner/LLM — Accepted in [ADR-0011](../decisions/0011-deterministic-scanner-and-llm-contracts.md):** immutable versioned deterministic findings; optional advisory LLM with no decision/action field; explicit `codex`, supported API, and `disabled` modes plus automatic “complete API, otherwise Codex” selection; configurable Codex model defaulting to `5.6-luna`; bounded best-effort Codex exposure; strict local output validation; visible failure and human pause without implicit fallback or autonomous veto.
11. **D11 — XDG/cleanup — Accepted in [ADR-0012](../decisions/0012-xdg-layout-permissions-retention.md):** use the exact XDG layout and private ownership/symlink controls above, 24-hour stale-work recovery, and finite configurable retention defaults: 365-day identity/decision/outcome history, 30-day reports/model JSON, 7-day state backups, 14-day or 512-MiB reconstructible recipe cache, and 3-day failed-work metadata.
12. **D12 — threat/tests — Accepted in [ADR-0013](../decisions/0013-aur-supply-chain-threat-model-and-v1-test-gates.md):** limit the adversary model to hostile AUR supply-chain input. Before v1, require a benign/suspicious recipe corpus, proof that inspection executes no package content, faithful evidence/error presentation with human authority, and one disposable-Arch review-to-install E2E. The local machine and account are outside the security guarantee.

13. **D13 — local PKGBUILD builds/repositories — Accepted in [ADR-0014](../decisions/0014-reject-local-pkgbuild-inputs-in-v1.md):** reject `-B`, targetless `-U`, local path targets, modes containing `pkgbuilds`, and any unexpected PKGBUILD record in v1 because Paru may execute `makepkg --printsrcinfo` before the guard; normalize allowed user modes with final trusted reset flags and design safe local-recipe support separately.
